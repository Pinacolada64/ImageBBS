------------------------------------
Entries to modules: (line 4000)

rk=1:     Called once when entering a sub/ud/ux
rk=2:     Called before the prompt is printed
rk=3:     Called to interpret commands

Notes:

     Local mode required to add U/X Config files, programs or
     modules, or to change the default device, drive, or
     subdirectory/user/partition.

     The General SubOp has SubOp access over all files in a
     particular directory (except U/X and programs, see above). 
     There is also slots for SubOps for just the posts, just the
     U/D's, and just the various forms of read-only files.

     The device, drive, and subdirectory/user/partition
     information in record 0 is copied to the entry automatically
     when a new post is made or a file is uploaded.  This means
     that mixed Subs and U/Ds in a single directory will end up
     in the same location (except where someone with local mode
     on changes them).

     Default Credits Charged: 0 for all items except files (U/D),
     which defaults to number of blocks in the file (of course,
     editable by SysOp/SubOp)

     The "Link" is a number that references a relative file
     record containing a list of the directory files where the
     same entry is duplicated.  For example, a post could be
     linked to other directories, and this number will allow the
     routines that update the number of responses/last response
     date to also update the other directories where the post can
     be viewed.
