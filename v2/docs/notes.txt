Wrong array name used in +/GF-maint
4201 a%=cm%(42,0)

+.GM defines
s%(39,60),e%(60),m%(3,25),q%(20,25):gosub3010

- changed cm%() array to s%() array

swap1.s: inline	  inline0  password useeditr
swap2.s: term	  chatmode btmvar   convert  sound
swap3.s: read0    newuser  relread  convdate copyrite

these aren't called by build.s:
swap4.s: putstruc getstruc lodstruc savstruc putdate  getdate  doscan
swap5.s: looks like "u.index" stuff
swapr.s: pageswap ecschk

info.GF-v2.txt:
Has multiple subops assigned
Why are "bytes" 2x the # of "elements" long? They wouldn't fit in the assigned positions otherwise.
Maybe leaving room for color bytes, like in the visual editor, when Ctrl-V is hit (displays color + character typed)

+.convert menu sets some fields in "e.menu x" struct:
3010 jm%(0,n)=1:jm%(1,n)=1023:jm%(2,n)=-1:n=n+1:on-(s=0andn<50)goto3008

+.menuedit:
jm%(0,n) flags
jm%(1,n) is access, obviously
jm%(2,n) ?
jm%(5,n) menu text

I've seen it sprinkled around, but it's now in the master variable 
list. 1.3/2.0's text output is more sophisticated; obviously 1.2 didn't do this.

Larry:
Reverse on does not get carried over to the next line in 1.3 and above.
Also, reverse off at the end of a line will force a word wrap to the next line
regardless of how much room is left in the line.

But by the same token, if there is still room in a line that begins with a reverse off, however much from the next line that will fit, will appear in reverse in the line above. Make sense?

Ray:
did some digging on the differences between &,60 and &,68 though
&,60 was the older version with less features
for any x > 1 (&,60,x,...) it just calls &,68
