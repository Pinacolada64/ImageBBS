Wrong array name used in +/GF-maint
4201 a%=cm%(42,0)

+.GM defines
s%(39,60),e%(60),m%(3,25),q%(20,25):gosub3010

- changed cm%() array to s%() array

swap1.s: inline	  inline0  password useeditr
swap2.s: term	  chatmode btmvar   convert  sound
swap3.s: read0    newuser  relread  convdate copyrite

these aren't called by build.s:
swap4.s: putstruc getstruc lodstruc savstruc putdate  getdate  doscan
swap5.s: looks like "u.index" stuff
swapr.s: pageswap ecschk

info.GF-v2.txt:
Has multiple subops assigned
Why are "bytes" 2x the # of "elements" long? They wouldn't fit in the assigned positions otherwise.
Maybe leaving room for color bytes, like in the visual editor, when Ctrl-V is hit (displays color + character typed)

+.convert menu sets some fields in "e.menu x" struct:
3010 jm%(0,n)=1:jm%(1,n)=1023:jm%(2,n)=-1:n=n+1:on-(s=0andn<50)goto3008

+.menuedit:
jm%(0,n) flags
jm%(1,n) is access, obviously
jm%(2,n) ?
jm%(5,n) menu text
