# ML Tests

`ml patcher.asm` - _(Unfinished)_ Patch ML files by supplying the original ML filename, the patch filename, and the output filename. I added a save routine, but it's still broken.
`base.asm`, `patch.asm` - sample files to test `ml patcher` with.

`break2.asm` - BASIC stub, a mostly functioning BRK handler that displays registers.

`break.asm` - _(Unfinished)_ Probably just delete this eventually.

`chatmode.asm` - _(Unfinished)_ Chat between two ports on a multiplexed Lt. Kernal hard drive. I added a copy routine for 

`dtoi.asm` - 11-digit Image date string to int conversion tests

`dumpm.asm` - dump arrays to disk, like `&,14`

`remote.asm` - purpose unknown, currently locks up the BBS under Image v3.0.

`serial.asm` - _(Unfinished)_ serial number manipulations. Missing `rand` routine.

`swiftlink-craig-bruce.asm` - SwiftLink driver by Craig Bruce

`visual.asm` - _(Unfinished)_ Start of a visual text editor.
