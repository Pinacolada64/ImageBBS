ASM v900728 Quick Reference

 AUTO [(step)]
  Turns auto line-numbering on or off. If the step value is 0, or missing, then
  it turns it off.

 BAS
  Exits the assembler without turning the function keys off.

 BYTE (string or numeric)[,...]
  This stores bytes at the current program counter.

 DMP
  Dumps the symbol table to the current output device.
 
 DUP (byte),(number)[,...]
  Stores (number) duplications of the (byte).

 ENC (byte)
  This set the current encryption byte. This byte is XOR'd with every byte 
  that is written with the assembler. Setting a value of 0 means no encryption.
  Note that the ORG command automatically sets the encrypt value to 0.

 INCLUDE (filename),(device)
  Includes a file as though it were in memory. Any errors that occur will
  print as the line number in the include file rather than the main file, but
  will NOT tell you that the error was in an include. Be careful of this.

 KLL
  JMP 64736.

 LSYM (filename),(device)
  Loads a symbol table.

 OLD
  Un-NEW.

 ORG (addr)[,(mode),(device),(filename)]
  Sets the Start Address. (mode) is the flag for the last pass. If (device)
  and (filename) are included, then assembly writes to disk. This also sets 
  the encrypt byte to 0. (See ENC)

 PRG (filename),(device)
  This includes data from a PRG file directly into the assembly. The load
  address is stripped off.

 RNM [(destline)]
  Renumbers the program by 10's all lines from 1000-59999. If (destline) is
  included, then it starts with that line for the new line numbers. Line
  references are NOT updated.

 SCR (string or numeric)[,...]
  This is a BYTE command that converts ASCII to Screen codes.

 SEQ (filename),(device)
  Includes a SEQ file from disk.

 SEND (string)
  Tokenizes a line of basic which will be included in the code you are
  assembling. Like: "1990 sys2062"

 SSYM (filename),(device)
  Saves the symbol table.

 UNSEND
  Writes three Zero's for the end of the basic section of the code.

 WORD (string or numeric)[,...]
  Stores words in the lo/hi format. String data is still stored as bytes.
