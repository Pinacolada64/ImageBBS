im:
+ 2904: make MM command RETURN instead of continuing into "Run" code.

+.CP:
+ temporarily ignore &,59,1,a (set input line length? crashes), use POKE 53252,<line length> instead.
+ more robust "?device not present" checks
+ fixed "Yes No Start Abort" response output

	i.CP
INFO	* should load proper screen mask (im=5, goto 443)
CHANGE	* added screen mask load, although in the wrong spot for now
	  Not sure if I want to keep it that way
FIXED	* added <CR> after copy option yes/no/start/abort/etc
BUG	* CP command doesn't output a CR after selecting "No" in file list
FIXED	* changed source/dest drives to be first device defined in system drive 
	  list

NEW	* now checks for device not present errors when entering device #'s and 
	  lets you re-enter
	* colorization, added credit

asm docs.txt:
+ added keyboard shortcuts

++ visual builds, wrote "+.visual test" which reads "s.visual" (which is a bunch of spaces?) and jumps to the editor. Ctrl-V shows color and text for each character typed, Ctrl-X exits. Lines do not display using traditional KK variable, maybe loaded into tt$(x) though.
- added .gitignore file
- added some source code
- added +.CP-modded (needs some work)

Renumbered +/GF-maint, fixed IM call

Renumbered from 3000- to 4000-, changed "gosub 3" to "gosub 1902" (for yes/no questions)
- turn MN mode (graphic menu) on, alter access level from lightbar, change to a=9, then /z appears in GF
- load +/GF-maint OK, crashes with ?bad subscript in 4415 when selecting "Prompt"

working on "+.test y2k patch", needs to bank out $a000 (basic) 1st
added more editor related labels from visual.s to equates20.lbl
trying to understand what format "ml patcher" patch files are in, may write a patch file for "ml 2.0"

27/Jul/2016 13:30
new mod_* labels for self-modifying code
changed .byte sequences to .word with \$([\da-f]{2}),(\$[\da-f]{2}) -> \2\1
changed 8 spaces to a tab

28/Jul/2016 14:47
fixed all mod_* labels, changed label names which were offsets from start of file to their absolute addresses
changed 'var' variable to fac1
added RS232 routine names
found MCI variable table, documented it

30/Jul/2016 20:58
casm 4.0 beta3 released, fixes using labels with pseudo-ops
no {alpha:} directive, so inverted 'ascii' text works for now
careful of comments after 'ascii' pseudo-ops, they are assembled too (bug)

30/Dec/2016 13:45
ml.editor:
renamed to ml_editor_converting.lbl
A few string fixups
.Abort now confirms, doesn't always work after choosing .New Text

equates-1_2.lbl:
Added more equates notes
