Chapter II: BASIC Subroutines
The purpose of this chapter is to provide you with all existing subroutines available for your use. All routines are shown being accessed through their recommended entry points. Some routines may be accessed through several entry points; others may not. Failure to use the proper entry points of the routines provided may cause undue garbage on the CPU stack or other problems with your programs.

1001

Position record of relative file currently open as logical file #2.

Expects:

X: Record desired.

Returns:

E%: Error number.
E$: Error message.
T%: Track number.
S%: Sector number.

1004

Checks status of user flags 1-15.

Expects:

A: flag number.

Returns:

A=0: Not accessible
A=1: Access allowed

User Flags
Each user has a total of 15 flags which decide whether or not they have access to a particular function or area of the system. These flags are held in a fifteen digit string, each digit representing a seperate flag which can be checked by setting the variable A to the flag number (1-15) and issuing a GOSUB 1004 command. If A returns with a value of zero, access is denied. The values of each flag are as follows:

 1 Non-Weed Access	 6 Editor Lines		11 BAR/Log Access
 2 Credit Ratio		 7 Unlimited Credits	12 Sub Maint
 3 Local Maint		 8 Remote Maint		13 Files Maint
 4 Post/Respond		 9 E-Mail Access	14 MCI Access
 5 U/D Access		10 User List Access	15 Prime Time U/D Access
