   Your tournament has gone well, but now your greatest rival, King
Urigard, has made a claim that his champion is the best in the land.  He
further states that he will meet any wager offered.

   Enraged by his boastful manner, you suggest that if your champion were to
lose, you would give him to the victor.  You ask King Urigard if he
is willing to do the same.  He seems a little nervous, but agrees.

   Now the match is under way, and with four passes already completed,
you begin to worry.  Then on the fifth pass, your champion finally
succeeds in unseating King Urigard's champion!  You have won!

You win 1 Noble!
