   For some time now you have been planning for your tournament.  Now,
the compliments of your guests make the preparations all worthwhile.

   Count Graznick, one of your rivals, approaches you and suggests that a
small wager would make the upcoming joust more interesting.  You agree,
and decide the winner gets a parcel of land along the common border your
two kingdoms share.

   It is now time for the joust.  The trumpets sound, and the two knights
urge their steeds forward.  With a crash of armor they meet!  You rise to
your feet with a cheer as Count Graznick's champion is knocked to the
ground!

You win 100 acres!!!
