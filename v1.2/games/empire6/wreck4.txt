    The wreckage your lookouts have spotted appears to be from several
ships.  As you drift by, you see a broken mast, splintered planks,
demolished crates, and an occasional body!

    Not seeing anything of value, you are about to give the order to resume
course, when a lookout gives a warning!

    You look in the direction he is pointing, and see a large water spout,
heading directly toward you!  You order full sail, in an attempt to get
out of its way, but too late!

    The water spout slams into your flotilla, doing considerable damage!
