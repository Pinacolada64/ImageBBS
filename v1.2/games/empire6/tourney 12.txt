    Your tournament has gone well, and now the upstart Baron Newsome in
all his arrogance has suggested a small wager between you.  Thinking to
put this pup in his place, you accept!

    Now it is time for the match! The trumpets sound, and the two Nobles
charge.  On the first pass, neither scores a hit.  On the second pass, your
champion scores a solid hit, unfortunately he too is hit solidly!  Baron
Newsome's champion manages to remain in the saddle; unfortunately, your
champion is laying on the ground!

    You have lost!  You lose 2 tons of timber!
