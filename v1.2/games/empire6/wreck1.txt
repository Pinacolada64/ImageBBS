   You have found the wreckage of a ship floating on the waves.  Timbers,
beams, and broken crates drift by.  Then, off in the distance, one of your
lookouts spots two small life boats.

   As you draw nearer, you see that they are filled to overflowing with
people.  You are seen as well, people waving a small plank with a white
shirt attached to attract your attention.

   You pull alongside and rescue 2 Nobles, 15 Soldiers, and 30 serfs!
