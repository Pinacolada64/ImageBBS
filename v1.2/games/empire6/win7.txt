    The mystical bird city.... is it a child's tale or does it really exist?
You finally decide to search for it in the small hope that it does exist.

    You and your men journey through the Endless Forest, a great sprawling
wood that lies to the west.  The city is rumored to lie in that general
direction.

    It takes you days to penetrate the dense foliage, but, eventually, you
arrive in the heart of the forest.... The sight that greets you defies all
description.

    Towers soar high above the ground and beautiful winding airways glisten in
the sun...  You are ushered immediately into the presence of the High King of
the Bird-Men: Lazarus!

    He stares at you compassionately. "So, you are the sad creatures with no
wings...  What a sad life you must live, unable to soar the skies, to feel the
wind at your back and the sun on your shoulders...  I would learn more of your
world...  Take four of my Captains...  May they serve you well!  Goodbye,
Wingless Ones!"

    You gain 4 Nobles!
