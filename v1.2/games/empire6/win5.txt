     The Cult of the Goddess of Evil has been a thorn in your side since
you first started ruling your kingdom. You decide to rid the kingdom of them
once and for all.

    You lead your men into their main temple and begin to burn their
horrible altars, their sacrificial daggers, and the executioners wielding
them.

    Then, as you are cleaning up the mess, you hear a voice inside your
head.  "STOP, human!  These are MY followers you are destroying!"

    You realize that you are listening to the Goddess of Evil herself.  "Yes,
Goddess.  YOUR followers!  The ones who kill children for sport, who eat
the entrails of animals...  who blind old men for the pleasure of watching
them crawl, begging and helpless on the ground!  Speak not to me of murder,
Goddess of Evil!  I will see your cult destroyed!"  And with that, you close
your mind to the insistent voice, turning instead to the business at hand.

    Because of your determination, High King Vaximian rewards you with
all the lands of the Goddess of Evil, a virtual kingdom in itself.

    You gain 4,000 acres!
