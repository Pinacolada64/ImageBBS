   To celebrate the good fortune your lands have been blessed with, you
decide to hold a tournament.

   All the Nobles have come to pit their champions against other champions
of the land.  One of your rivals, Prince Lloyd, suggests a land dispute
between the two of you might be settled by a single competition: his
champion against yours.  Feeling lucky, you agree.

   As word spreads of the side bet, all eyes turn to the "Field of Honor."
Both Prince Lloyd's and your champion line up for the joust.  The trumpets
sound, and they charge!

   The crowd rises as your champion's horse stumbles.  Unfortunately, it was
at the moment the two knights met.  Your champion, thrown off balance, is
knocked from his horse.

You lose 100 acres!
