   You land on a mist-shrouded island, which appears to be uninhabited.  You
and your men spread out to explore the island.
   While pushing your way through a tangle of brush, you come upon a
boulder with a cross carved on it.  Deciding that this is a good omen, you
instruct your men to dig beneath the boulder.
   After many hours of digging, your men discover a chest.  Anticipation
mounts, as you order it opened.

   Inside, you find 90,000 gold!
