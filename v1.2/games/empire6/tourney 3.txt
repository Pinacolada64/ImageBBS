   Your tournament has gone well, and your champion seems invincible.  Baron
Stallworth approaches you and suggests a small wager on the joust between his
champion and yours.  With confidence, you agree.
   As the two champions await the signal for the contest to begin, Baron
Stallworth's champion suddenly leans forward, and falls from his horse.
   Physicians rush forward as the crowd is silenced by the scene.  It is
determined that Baron Stallworth's champion has had an attack of
appendicitis and can't continue.  You claim the victory, by default!

You win 1,000 gold!!
