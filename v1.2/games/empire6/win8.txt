    You have long heard the story, of a ship at the base of a mountain. 
Knowing that no one would build a ship so far from the ocean, you have
dismissed the tale as serfs' superstition.

    Then, one day, you came across an ancient manuscript.  It told of a great
tidal wave which hit the land long ago, carrying houses for miles inland.  You
wonder if a ship could have been carried as far as the mountains.  With your
curiosity aroused, you set off with some of your Nobles in search of the ship. 

    After many weeks of searching, you are about to give up when one of
your men gives a shout!  You look up, and see he is pointing at something.

    Climbing to the top of a small hill, you look in the direction he is
pointing.  There, before your eyes, is the rotting remains of a small ship. 
Upon closer examination, you find some cannon, which may be useful, otherwise,
the ship is a total loss.

   You gain 6 cannons!
