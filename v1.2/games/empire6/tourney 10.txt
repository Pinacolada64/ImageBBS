   For some time now, you and Prince Glascow, have disputed the ownership
of a parcel of land.  He suggests the dispute be solved by a joust between
his champion and yours.  You confidently agree!

   Now the two champions are facing each other awaiting the sound of the
trumpets.  With the sound of the trumpets, they charge!

   Meeting with a crash, you see your champion suspended in air as he is
knocked off his horse on the first pass!  You have lost!

You lose 100 acres and a Shipyard!
