   You have anchored in a cove of a mist-shrouded island.  You send some
of your Nobles and Soldiers ashore to explore the island.
   After several hours, one of your Nobles returns to report their findings.
   He reports that the island has much timber and a herd of wild horses!

   You gain 100 horses, and 20 tons of timber!
