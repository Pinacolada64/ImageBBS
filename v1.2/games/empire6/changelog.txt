	Empire 6.0 enhancements:

	This year's harvest is xxxx bushels, for a total of yyyy bushels.
	
REMOVE	"Press Any Key" prompts between "Totals, Receivables, and Payables"
	and "Nobles and Palaces" in status readouts

FIXED	"Colonys" -> "Colonies"
	To add: +.empire6 -- print "colon[y|ies]" line
NEW	
	Other Rulers listing:
	## Name			[Acres] <- add Acres listing
	01 PINACOLADA.............5000	(most folks don't know what this # is)
	
	Colonists:
	Make RETURN key select maximum # of bushels to feed serfs instead of 
	typing #:
	
	Supply how many bushels of grain (RETURN=xxx)
	
	Marketplace	Move $ amount left one space
	Grain Mill	Same
	
	During combat, space or / should abort
	
	pf^1^12
	Locked up on line 22 (which module?)
	
	Wall scan by date broken? May be picking up on 2096 dates though...
	
	On carrier drop, save stats, don't just go to main prompt! :P
	
	Common subroutines in +.empire6:
		Display player statistics
		Look up player records
	+	Put routines in Empire6.lbl

	If money negative, skip "You can buy soldiers" prompt.
	
FIX	c$ is defined as chr$(13) multiple times: doesn't IM define r$ as 
	chr$(13)? Yes it does. Changed.

CHANGE	Move Empire WallWriter to +.emp6.startup instead of taking up space in 
	"+.empire 6"

WIP	Create LMP modules
WISH	Add quests like Centipede 128 - thanks CyberJank for Centipede Empire
NEW	Add DEF FN R() for generating random numbers (saves lots of space: 79 
		instances of RND)

INFO	Consider Andrew's bug report about money being siphoned off his account:

	13/Jul/2010 19:29
	    -- No Responses --
	
	I believe I've found a bug in the Empire game here... I thought it was
	odd that I seemed to be losing money every turn, and at the beginning
	of each turn, I'd start out with negative dollars.  Well, at the end
	of my last turn, I paid attention to the breakdown of where the money
	was going.  When it listed the total receivables and payables, it said
	there was $2116 in payables.  But after that, when it gives the
	detailed breakdown in each category, the only payable amount was $216
	to soldier pay.  So I'm basically being robbed of $1900!  And I
	believe this is happening every turn.  Can this be fixed?

FIX	Change GOSUB 1006 to {pound}i1 - although 1006 does take care of
		command stacking... so may be worth leaving in.
CHANGE	{pound}Cx -> C64List color codes, {pound}f1 -> {clear}
NEW	Declare Z$ as all-purpose work string variable.
CHANGE	Bump game version number up to 6.0
CHANGE	Remove GO(TO|SUB) 1029 - it just does a &:RETURN
NEW	Add my comma-delimited number routine
FIX	Die, Headline Text, Die
NEW	Declare consistent a% integer variable for calculations (removes need
		for INT) plus ease of display in MCI strings: rather than
		&"xyz"+str$(a)+"abc", use &"xyz {pound}%a abc"
WISH	Empire AutoMaint module to rotate news logs

11/Aug/2014 15:27
NEW	Use L$ (either {f6} or {space} depending on ll%, for 40/80 displays)
	(changed L$ to z$ in wall-writer routine)

TODO	emp6_colony:
		Is in tok64 format or something, not c64list format -- {f6*2}
		instead of {f6:2}, {reverse on} instead of {rvrs on} -- fix it

12/Aug/2014 10:48
	Empire6.lbl:
NEW		When feeding armies, if gr (grain available) < ar (grain for army)
		set gr=ar for "Return=xxxx" prompt

NEW		{:sub.load_lmp} -- subroutine handles LMP linking & execution:
		* LMPs must start at line 800, end in RETURN. Pass a$="module" and
		the module loaded is "+.emp6.module" from the plus-file drive

	emp6_startup:
CHANGE	Wall-writer filename is now "e.emp6wall" to avoid clobbering
		an existing wall from Empire 5.1
	emp6_maint:
NEW		"modified" flag logic changed, prompts now show old values
NEW		shows modified status when displaying player stats
REMOVED	"P"lay Empire option since LMPs need to RETURN to main module
	empire6:
NEW		local mode (zz) considered when loading editor, not just access
		level 9
REMOVED	"R"eset Empire option from main menu, accessed through
		"M"aintenance now (it's duplicated there anyway)

	Globally:
		Standardize "on -(tr%<1) goto {:save_stats_quit}" to "on tr%+1 goto {:save_stats_quit}"
		("goto {:save_stats_quit}" does a "gosub {:sub.save_your_stats}")
		(tr%: time remaining on BBS, {:save_stats_quit} - save stats, quit)

13/Aug/2014 15:56
	Empire Deluxe from Centipede 128 BBS:
FIXED	Typographical errors and removed about a bazillion extra commas in
		documentation, island and tournament texts

22/Aug/2014 13:31
	
WIP		Ability to remove cargo from ship manifest
WISH	Separate help files per prompt

29/Sep/2014 14:34
NEW		Change GOSUB 1002 to GOSUB 1001 (more chances of properly positioning REL pointer)
REMOVE	{pound}vz isn't a valid Image MCI command

NEW		{:sub.request_your_status} where on -(an$="Y") gosub {:sub.your_status}
NEW		When in combat and carrier dropped, save yours & enemy stats
