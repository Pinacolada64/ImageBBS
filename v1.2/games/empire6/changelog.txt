(Tab width: 4)

		Empire 6.0 enhancements:

		This year's harvest is xxxx bushels, for a total of yyyy bushels.
	
REMOVE	"Press Any Key" prompts between "Totals, Receivables, and Payables"
		and "Nobles and Palaces" in status readouts

FIXED	"Colonys" -> "Colonies"
		To add: +.empire6 -- print "colon[y|ies]" line
NEW		
		Other Rulers listing:
		## Name			[Acres] <- add Acres listing
		01 PINACOLADA.............5000	(most folks don't know what this # is)
	
		Colonists:
		Make RETURN key select maximum # of bushels to feed serfs instead of 
		typing #:
	
		Supply how many bushels of grain (RETURN=xxx)
	
		Marketplace	Move $ amount left one space
		Grain Mill	Same
	
		During combat, space or / should abort
	
		pf^1^12
		Locked up on line 22 (which module?)
	
		Wall scan by date broken? May be picking up on 2096 dates though...
	
		On carrier drop, save stats, don't just go to main prompt! :P
	
		Common subroutines in +.empire6:
			Display player statistics
			Look up player records
		+	Put routines in Empire6.lbl

		If money negative, skip "You can buy soldiers" prompt.
	
FIX		c$ is defined as chr$(13) multiple times: doesn't IM define r$ as 
		chr$(13)? Yes it does. Changed.

CHANGE	Move Empire WallWriter to +.emp6.startup instead of taking up space in 
		"+.empire 6"

			-- Nov 13, 2012 21:39 --
WIP		Create LMP modules
WISH	Add quests like Centipede 128 - thanks CyberJank for Centipede Empire
NEW		Add DEF FN R() for generating random numbers (saves lots of space: 79 
			instances of RND)

INFO	Consider Andrew's bug report about money being siphoned off his account:

		13/Jul/2010 19:29
		    -- No Responses --
		
		I believe I've found a bug in the Empire game here... I thought it was
		odd that I seemed to be losing money every turn, and at the beginning
		of each turn, I'd start out with negative dollars.  Well, at the end
		of my last turn, I paid attention to the breakdown of where the money
		was going.  When it listed the total receivables and payables, it said
		there was $2116 in payables.  But after that, when it gives the
		detailed breakdown in each category, the only payable amount was $216
		to soldier pay.  So I'm basically being robbed of $1900!  And I
		believe this is happening every turn.  Can this be fixed?

FIX		Change GOSUB 1006 to {pound}i1 - although 1006 does take care of
			command stacking... so may be worth leaving in.
CHANGE	{pound}Cx -> C64List color codes, {pound}f1 -> {clear}
NEW		Declare Z$ as all-purpose work string variable.
CHANGE	Bump game version number up to 6.0
CHANGE	Remove GO(TO|SUB) 1029 - it just does a &:RETURN
NEW		Add my comma-delimited number routine
FIX		Die, Headline Text, Die
NEW		Declare consistent a% integer variable for calculations (removes need
			for INT) plus ease of display in MCI strings: rather than
			&"xyz"+str$(a)+"abc", use &"xyz {pound}%a abc"
WISH	Empire AutoMaint module to rotate news logs

11/Aug/2014 15:27
NEW		Use L$ (either {f6} or {space} depending on ll%, for 40/80 displays)
		(changed L$ to z$ in wall-writer routine)

TODO	emp6_colony:
			Is in tok64 format or something, not c64list format -- {f6*2}
			instead of {f6:2}, {reverse on} instead of {rvrs on} -- fix it

		Empire6.lbl:
NEW			When feeding armies, if gr (grain available) < ar (grain for army)
			set gr=ar for "Return=xxxx" prompt

NEW			{:sub.load_lmp} -- subroutine handles LMP linking & execution:
			* LMPs must start at line 800, end in RETURN. Pass a$="module" and
				the module loaded is "+.emp6.module" from the plus-file drive

		emp6_startup:
CHANGE		Wall-writer filename is now "e.emp6wall" to avoid clobbering
			an existing wall from Empire 5.1
		emp6_maint:
NEW			"modified" flag logic changed, prompts now show old values
NEW			shows modified status when displaying player stats
REMOVED		"P"lay Empire option since LMPs need to RETURN to main module
		empire6:
NEW			local mode (zz) considered when loading editor, not just access
				level 9
REMOVED		"R"eset Empire option from main menu, accessed through
				"M"aintenance now (it's duplicated there anyway)

		Globally:
			Standardize "on -(tr%<1) goto {:save_stats_quit}" to "on tr%+1 goto {:save_stats_quit}"
			("goto {:save_stats_quit}" does a "gosub {:sub.save_your_stats}")
			(tr%: time remaining on BBS, {:save_stats_quit} - save stats, quit)

13/Aug/2014 15:56
		Empire Deluxe from Centipede 128 BBS:
FIXED	Typographical errors and removed about a bazillion extra commas in
			documentation, island and tournament texts

22/Aug/2014 13:31
		
WIP			Ability to remove cargo from ship manifest
WISH		Separate help files per prompt

29/Sep/2014 14:34
NEW			Change GOSUB 1002 to GOSUB 1001 (more chances of properly positioning REL pointer)
REMOVE		{pound}vz isn't a valid Image MCI command

NEW			{:sub.request_your_status} where on -(an$="Y") gosub {:sub.your_status}
NEW			When in combat and carrier dropped, save yours & enemy stats
