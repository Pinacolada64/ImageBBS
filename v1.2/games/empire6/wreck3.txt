    The wreckage your lookouts have spotted appears to be from a merchantman.
A broken mast, splintered planks, and a large number of crates drift by.

    Noticing that some of the crates appear to be intact, you order them
hauled aboard.

    Upon closer examination, you discover they are full of exports.  In fact,
you end up with 5 tons of good Exports!
