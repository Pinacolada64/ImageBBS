   You have landed on a mist-shrouded island.  You send your troops out to
explore.
   As your forces begin to spread out, you hear a blood-curdling scream!  One
of your men drops, with an arrow through his neck!
   More arrows fly through the air, taking their toll.  You order your men
back to the ships, as waves of cannibals emerge from the thick brush.
Other cannibals are headed for your ships, in dugout canoes.

   You finally beat off the cannibals but suffer some losses!
