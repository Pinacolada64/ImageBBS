   Your champion is Greystoke, and though he is a boastful Noble, he is
also a winner!  Now one of your rivals approaches, and asks if you feel
like a small wager.  Feeling your champion can defeat his, and knowing
you had a poor harvest this year, you suggest the wager be in bushels of
grain.  He accepts!
   Now it is time for the match!  The trumpets sound, and the two Nobles
charge!  With a crash of armor and shields, they meet!  True to his form,
your champion struts away, leaving his opponent gasping for air, in the
dust!  You have won!

You win 7,000 bushels of grain!
