
    You have heard that a band of pirates has been raiding the area
recently, causing much strife to the poor serfs in your dominion.  
Thus it is with a stout heart and a sharp sword that you determine to
rid your kingdom of these pests once and for all.

    After a meeting with your nobles, you decide that the best route of
invasion would be through a secret tunnel which one of your spies
discovered about a month ago.  It leads into a storage room to the
north of the pirates' main cave.

    This course determined, your hardy band sets out for the cave less
than a week later.  You arrive at the secret tunnel and, after checking
for sentries, enter the passage.

   Your invasion is swift and merciless, and the pirate camp is soon under
your control.  Flushed with victory, your band counts the treasure which
you have received.

   You gain 30,000 gold!!
