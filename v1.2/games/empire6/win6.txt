    You have heard of a distant land which is rich in the finest spices. 
You have thought many times about setting sail in search of this land.  Now 
you have decided to look for this land.

    You have hired a small vessel, and with some of your Nobles and their
men, you set sail on your adventure.

    After many weeks, you are considering turning back.  Then the call "Land
ho!" comes down from the crow's nest.  

    Sure enough: in the hazy distance there is the outline of a large island.
Having seen other islands without finding the "Island of Spice," you still
hold a faint hope.  But you decide that if this one turns out to be just
another island, you will set sail for home.

    However, on approaching the island, your nostrils detect the sweet scent
of spices -- you have found the fabled "Island of Spice!"

   You gain 40 tons of Spices!!
