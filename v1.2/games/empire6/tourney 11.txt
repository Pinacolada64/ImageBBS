   Your tournament is a sight to behold with the flags and crests of all the
nobility in attendance making for a colorful and impressive display.

   Now one of your rivals, Prince Draconas, has suggested a small wager on
the outcome of the match between his champion and yours.  You hesitantly
agree.

   Now it is time for the match.  The two Nobles sit astride their charges,
awaiting the sound of the trumpets.  The trumpets sound, the two champions
charge, and with a crash of armor, Prince Draconas' champion flies from
his horse!  You have won!

You win 2 tons of timber!
