   You are very pleased with the turnout for your tournament.  Now one
of your rivals has approached you suggesting that his champion can
easily defeat yours.  You take offence at his attitude, and offer a small
wager.  He accepts with a grin.
   Now it is time for the match. Your champion looks confident as the
trumpets sound and the two knights charge.  On the first pass, only
glancing blows are delivered.  Now they charge each other again!  With a
crash of armor they meet, and this time your champion is knocked from
his horse.  You have lost!

You lose 1,000 gold!!
