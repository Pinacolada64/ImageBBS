    As you drift by the wreckage, it becomes apparent that there is nothing
of any value to salvage.  Still, you feel you have an obligation to search
thoroughly, in case of any survivors.
    After about an hour of searching, you find your ships heading into a fog
bank.  Knowing that you are well out to sea, you order lanterns lit, and
proceed with your search.
    Shortly after entering the fog, the wind picks up.  The waves begin to
break over your bow!  You order 180 about, to escape the fog, but too late!
Your ships are devastated!
