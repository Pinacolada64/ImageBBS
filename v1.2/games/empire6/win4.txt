    Your land has suffered a terrible drought.  Being a caring ruler, you
have prayed for deliverance for many months.  You have diligently made
sacrifices to the gods and have refused to give up hope.

    Then in a dream you had an image of an island in the swamps.  This
island was covered with grain.  When you awoke, you were left with the
impression that the island is in a swamp on your land.  Arising, you
decide to search the swamp for this bounty.

    You gather your nobles together, and outline your plan for a thorough
search of the swamp.  Convinced that this is a sign from the gods, you begin
your quest.

    After several weeks of searching, you are about to give up hope.  On the
next day, however, you hack your way through a thick mass of vines and see
before you the image of your dream!  You have found the island of grain!

    You gain 40,000 bushels of grain!
