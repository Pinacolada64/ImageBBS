   You have anchored in a cove of a barren, mist-shrouded island.  The
island is dominated by a large, cone-shaped mountain.
   As you explore the island, the ground begins to rumble!  Quickly, you
order everyone back to your ships. But before you can leave the cove,
the top of the mountain explodes!
   Rock and molten lava are thrown in the air, as the volcano erupts!

   Your flotilla is damaged in the eruption!
