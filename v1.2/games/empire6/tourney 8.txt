    You have planned long for this tournament, and it has really gone
well.  Many of your rivals are in attendance, and you hope to add some
insult to injury.  One of your rivals, Baron Hellguard, has had a bad year. 
You think you can make it worse with a small wager.  Though his champion
hasn't been doing well, Baron Hellguard accepts.

    With a contemptuous snort, your champion looks at his opponent.  Now
the trumpets sound, and the two Nobles charge!  Unbelievably, you watch in
disgust as your champion is unseated on the first pass.  You have lost!

You lose 7,000 bushels of grain!
