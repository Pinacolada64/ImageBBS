   Your tournament has gone well up to this point.  Now your greatest rival,
Duke Mumford, boasts that his champion is the best in the land.  He further
states he is willing to pit his champion against yours, with the winner to
get the loser's champion.

   You feel you have little choice but to accept, so, with not a little
anticipation, you wait for the joust to begin.

   On the first pass, both Nobles score glancing blows, but neither is
unseated.  Unfortunately on the second pass, Duke Mumford's champion scores a
solid blow, leaving your champion on the ground, coughing in the dust!  You
have lost!

You lose 1 Noble!
