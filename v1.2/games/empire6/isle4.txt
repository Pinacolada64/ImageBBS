   You have anchored in a cove of a mist-shrouded island.  You send a
party of Nobles and Soldiers ashore to explore.
   With your forces halfway to shore, you hear the crack of muskets! 
Looking towards the entrance to the cove, you see a small vessel exiting
the thick mist.
   It is a pirate ship!  The pirates have caught you off guard!

   Your forces are severely damaged before they can regroup and drive the
pirates off!
