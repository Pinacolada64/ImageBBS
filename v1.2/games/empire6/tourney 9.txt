   Up to this point, your tournament has gone well.  Unfortunately, your
greatest rival has also shown up.  He proposes settling a dispute
involving a Shipyard and some land by a single contest.  Reluctantly, you
agree.

   The arena falls into silence as word of the wager spreads.  All in
attendance watch as your champion prepares for the contest.

   With the blaring of trumpets, the two Nobles charge!  Then with a crash
of armor, you rise in pride, as your rival's Noble hits the ground!  You
have won!

   You win 1 Shipyard, and 100 acres of land!
