   You are in need of timber for your forts and ships.  Your land is well-
suited for growing grain, but you have very little timber.

   So, at last you decide if your empire is to survive, you must find a source
of timber.  Discussing this with your Nobles, you decide to lead an expedition
into the mountains. Though most of the trees are bent from the high winds, you
have heard of a small valley, with good timber.

   You and your men have been searching for some weeks, when you come upon a
young woman.  She is in tears, explaining a band of brigands had captured her
and her sister.  They were being used as slave labor at the brigands' camp.
She further explains she managed to slip away, and begs you to come and free
her sister.

    Considering that these brigands may some day become a threat to your land,
you agree.  So it was that when you and your men came upon the brigands, you
were prepared to fight. The brigands, believing themselves safe, were caught
off guard.

    Your seasoned troops make quick work of the task.  But you have found
something more.  The brigands' camp is in a small valley with good timber!

   You gain 15 tons of timber!!
