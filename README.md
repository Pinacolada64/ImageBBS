A bulletin board program for the Commodore 64.

Source code is handled using Jeff Hoag's "C64List" utility:
http://www.commodoreserver.com/Downloads.asp - look for "C64List3.03.zip".

C64List is a command-line utility to convert BASIC programs from a friendly text format to its native C64 PRG format and back. You can also add assembly code that gets loaded at the end of a BASIC program. There are many other features. Visit the [Bit 64 Blog]: http://commodoreserver.com/BlogView.asp?BID=620460DB83BF4CC1AE7FEF4E9AB4A228 for more information.

Uppercase quoted characters A-Z ($c1-$da} range will eventually be more readable by using C64List's {quoter:} directive.
When converting .prg files, use `-alpha:upper`.
